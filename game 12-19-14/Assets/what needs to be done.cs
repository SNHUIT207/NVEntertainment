	//The player needs to be able to shoot the zombie, so far he can make the bullet (which is a heart cause I couldn't find a sprite) appear on the screen but they go crazy.
	// I think we should just make this part of the challenge- you're trying to kill zombies but your gun is going insane.

	//The zombies need to follow him and be shot at. So far the zombies spawn but they don't go anywhere, and I don't think the player can shoot them yet. 

	//The zombie prefab is still there, I just deleted the one on the hierarchy so that I could figure out what was wrong with the player.

	//We need a game over screen and a main menu screen. These are pretty easy to make, in comparison with the game.

	//The player also should be able to rotate. He can't. But this isn't the most important thing.

	//Sounds would be good too, but this isn't a high priority either.
